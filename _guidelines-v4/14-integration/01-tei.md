The TEI's Special Interest Group on Music has come up with an ODD customization for TEI, which allows to embed MEI excerpts into TEI. However, the SIG Music is officially considered *dormant*, so the information provided is somewhat outdated. The most recent resources are available from <a href="https://github.com/TEI-Music-SIG/tei-mei/" target="\_blank">GitHub</a>.

As of yet, no official MEI customization to include elements from the TEI namespace into MEI has been written, even though this is definitely wanted.
