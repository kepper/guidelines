In this chapter, the combination of MEI with other relevant formats in the field is covered. Here, the MEI Guidelines try to serve as Best Practice Recommendations; they don't claim to provide full and / or authoritative documentation for those other formats. The intention is to provide good starting points and share experience across various projects, trying to unify both tools and workflows for better efficiency. Accordingly, if the information found here provides as outdated or incomplete, please <a href="https://music-encoding.org/community/community-contacts.html">get in touch</a>.
